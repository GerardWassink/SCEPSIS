# Description of the ALU instructions

## ALU instruction result
The result of ALU instructions always ends up in register A. Register A is
the implicit first operand of the ALU instructions. The second operand is
determined by the mode bits in the instruction's opcode as follows:

## Coding the bits
Opcode bits that control the working of the ALU:

<PRE>
76543210
+----+--
|    |_________		bits 210 control the operation
|______________		bits 76543 are the identifying part of the ALU ops
</PRE>

### ALU operations
Binary values for ALU operations:

<PRE>
xxxx x000 - Add
xxxx x001 - Subtract
xxxx x010 - Compare
xxxx x011 - And
xxxx x100 - Or
xxxx x101 - Xor
xxxx x110	
xxxx x111	
</PRE>

### ALU addressing modes
The addressing mode controls where the second operand of the instruction comes from. 

- Immediate- (operand directly in instruction)
- Memory   - (operand in memory, address in instruction)
- REGB     - (operand in register B)

These modes depend on the micro step definitions for a specific instruction. The table below gives a suggestion for coding them.

### Decoding the instructions

#### Extracting the ALU operation
The ALU operation can be extracted from the Instruction Register 
as follows:

 ALUoperation = (comp_INR & x7)	/* mask is binary '00000111' */

## The possible ALU instructions
In the table below you find the possible variations of the ALU instructions in the 
way they are coded in SCEPSIS. The modes (bits 4 and 3 of the opcode) are suggestions 
to make the instruction set more structured. Coded in this way the instruction:

 CPM 3A

meaning: compare register a with the contents of memory at address x'3A', would be coded as:

    'xxx 01 010   0011 1010' (binary)

You could opt to code the opcodes for ALU operations starting with '111', as I will do 
in my example langdef file. Then it would be:

    '111 01 010   0011 1010' (binary) or: 'EA 3A' (hexadecimal)
