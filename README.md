## Simple CPU Emulator Program (Student Instruction System)

### Purpose

Educating people into the concepts of low-level computing, by emulating a simple CPU. The properties of this CPU will be:

- 8 bits
- ability to define microcode
- thus being able to create one's own instruction set
- combined data- and address bus

### Background

For a bit more background read this [page about the "von Neumann machine"](https://geronimo370.nl/computers/theory/the-von-neumann-machine/). It describes the famous '**fetch - decode - get data - execute**' cycle

## To be done:

### Decide on the hardware components to be emulated

To build a computer we need components:

- **CPU** - Central Processing Unit
- **CNB** - CoNtrol Bus, means of control the different components
- **DAB** - DAta Bus, a way to transport data back and forth
- **INP** - means to input stuff
- **OUT** - some way of outputting things
- **RAM** - Memory

### Inside the actual CPU

Further down, inside the CPU we have components as well:

- **ALU** - Arithmetic Logical Unit
- **CLK** - A CLocK pulse generator
- **CTU** - ConTrol Unit
- **INP** - INPut Register
- **INR** - INstruction Register
- **MAR** - Memory Address Register
- **OUT** - OUTput Register
- **PCT** - Program CounTer
- **RGA** - ReGister A
- **RGB** - ReGister B
- **STC** - STep Counter for microcode steps


## Control signals that are needed for these components

Every component in a CPU has functions, al of which can be controlled by control signals; all these control signals together form the 'control bus'. Bus is a fancy way in computer tech speak to indicate a number of signals combined in one 'bundle of wires'. [For an example of control signals look here](https://geronimo370.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Microcode_control_signals.pdf "Example of Control Signals").

- **CE** - Counter Enable, the program counter advances to the next instruction
- **HLT** - stop (or HALT) the processor
- **INPO** - Set the input register to output, put its on the DAB
- **INRI** - Set the instruction register to input, to take a value from the DAB
- **INRO** - Set the instruction register to output, put its on the DAB
- **MARI** - Set the MAR to input, accept an address from the DAB
- **MARO** - Set the MAR to output, put it out to the DAB
- **OUTI** - Set the output register to input, getting a value from the DAB
- **PCTI** - Set the Program Counter to input, getting a value from the DAB
- **PCTO** - Set the Program Counter to output, put it's value to the DAB
- **RAMI** - Set memory, pointed to by MAR to input, getting the value from the DAB
- **RAMO** - Set memory, pointed to by MAR to output, put value on the DAB
- **RGAI** - Set RGA to input, accept a value from the DAB
- **RGAO** - Set RGA to output, put its value out to the DAB
- **RGBI** - Set RGA to input, accept a value from the DAB
- **RGBO** - Set RGA to output, put its value out to the DAB
- ...


## Instructions as a combination of Control Signals

Now that all Control Signals have been defined we can think of ways to combine them to have the computer do what we want it to do.

### An example

As an example we will describe a simple instruction that will get the value that has been input by the user and put it memory location 42. We call this instruction I2M (Input to Memory). This instruction would read:

	I2M 42

#### The fetch phase

The first thing for every instruction is that we have to ***fetch*** the actual instruction from memory. As we shall see this incorporates the use of several Control Signals in subsequent microcode steps.

The fetch phase is exactly the same for every instruction. This is the combination of Control Signals for the fetch phase:

##### microcode for the fetch phase

- Clock Cycle 1 - PCTO + MARI - *put the value of the PCT in the MAR*
- Clock Cycle 2 - RAMO + INRI + CE - *put the value out of memory into the INR and bump the PCT up by 1*

Now, after two clock ticks, we have read the value out of memory (pointed to by the Program Counter), that is the value of the next instruction, into the Instruction Register from where it can be decoded; lastly, we had the PCT point to the next instruction.

#### The decode phase

In our little CPU there will not be microcode for the ***decode*** phase. We assume that the **INR** is connected to the decode logic, which will in its turn produce the microcode needed to perform the instruction.

#### The get data phase

The ***get data*** phase will take care of obtaining the data that is needed for the execution of our instruction, whether it be from a register, from memory or from the outside world. 

In this case it will get the address from memory, it is stored right after the instruction, so we need the **PCT** for that (remember we bumped it at the end of the fetch phase?). After use we have to make sure to bump it again to point to the next instruction!

##### microcode for the get data phase

- Clock Cycle 3 - PCTO + MARI - *put value from the PCT on the DAB and read the value into the MAR*

The MAR is now pointing to location 42.

#### The execute phase

In this case, the ***execute*** phase will get the data from the input register, and put it into memory at the desired location.

##### microcode for the execute phase

- Clock Cycle 4 - INPO + RAMI + CE - *put value from the input register on the DAB and have RAM read it in into the proper location; then bump the PCT again*
