# SCEPSIS

## Simple CPU Emulator Program (Student Instruction System)

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to educate people in the concepts of low-level computing, by emulating a simple CPU. The properties of this CPU will be:

- 8 bits
- fixed number of given components & control signals
- ability to define custom microcode
- thus being able to create one's own instruction set
- combined data- and address bus

### Background

For a bit more background read this [page about the "von Neumann machine"](https://geronimo370.nl/computers/theory/the-von-neumann-machine/). It describes the famous '**fetch - decode - get data - execute**' cycle
